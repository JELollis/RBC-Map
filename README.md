# RBC Community Map Application

**Current documented release: 1.0.0** · [Repository](https://github.com/JELollis/RBC-Map) · [Changelog](Changelog.md)

RBC Community Map is a Python desktop companion for **Vampires! The Dark Alleyway** in [RavenBlack City](https://quiz.ravenblack.net/blood.pl). It combines an interactive minimap, character management, community-maintained location information, and in-game planning tools.

## Features

### Interactive minimap
- Follow the character's current position using the game's right-hand frame.
- Show routes to the nearest **transit station** (red), **bank** (blue), and **pub** (orange).
- Choose a **3×3** (default), **5×5**, **7×7**, or **9×9** view.
- Recenter by clicking a map cell or choosing a location from the dropdowns and selecting **Go**.
- Use **Set Destination** to mark a destination and display its route in green.
- Customize the minimap theme; fallback rendering helps maintain usability in zoomed views.
- Refresh destination choices when the destination dialog opens.

### Community location data
- Synchronize guild and shop movements and community-supplied buildings, points of interest, arenas, alchemy locations, lairs, and halls.
- Optionally enable **Contribute Discovered Locations** to report newly discovered non-moving locations anonymously. You can turn this setting off at any time.
- Continue using previously synchronized local location data when the update service is unavailable.

### Characters and controls
- Store character login details locally and switch between characters.
- Restore destinations, themes, and other preferences between sessions.
- Choose **WASD** or **arrow keys** for movement; movement shortcuts are suppressed while typing into input fields.

## Getting started

### Requirements
The Python runtime dependencies listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) are:
- PySide6 (including the Qt WebEngine components used by the embedded browser)
- beautifulsoup4
- requests

A working Python 3 installation and an environment capable of running a Qt desktop application are required. Supported Python versions and platform-specific packaging instructions should be verified against the release you intend to run.

### Install dependencies

From a checkout of the repository, create and activate a virtual environment, then install the declared dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For a packaged build, check the repository's [releases](https://github.com/JELollis/RBC-Map/releases) for available downloads and release-specific instructions. The appropriate application entry point may vary by version; consult the selected release's documentation rather than running an archived script from `Version Control/`.

## Data and privacy

Character information, credentials, session state, and application preferences are stored in a local SQLite database. The documented community reporting feature is **opt-in** and is intended to send only newly discovered non-moving locations, not login credentials. Review the application's settings before enabling reporting, and protect your local database and device as you would other stored credentials.
