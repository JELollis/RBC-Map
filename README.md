RBC Community Map is a Python desktop companion for **Vampires! The Dark Alleyway** in
[RavenBlack City](https://quiz.ravenblack.net/blood.pl).

## About 0.7.2: SQLite cookie storage & character persistence

**Upgrades:**

Replaced pickle-based cookies with SQLite-backed cookie DB (cookies.db).

Introduced:

initialize_cookie_db(), save_cookie_to_db(), load_cookies_from_db()

Character persistence logic now loads last active character automatically.

AVITDScraper integrated into app load to update DB automatically.

💾 First use of SQLite local state. Better for scaling.

See the [Changelog](Changelog.md#version-072--sqlite-cookie-storage--character-persistence) for details and earlier history.
