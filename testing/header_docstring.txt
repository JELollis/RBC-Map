RBC City Map Application (v0.13.0)
=================================

This application provides an interactive mapping and character management tool for the browser-based vampire RPG
**Vampires! The Dark Alleyway**, set in the fictional RavenBlack City.

Version 0.13.0 represents a significant internal refinement of the monolithic architecture used in earlier releases.
While the application is still packaged as a single file, major upgrades include improved nickname normalization,
external API integration, enhanced minimap accuracy, and multiple dialog updates to improve usability and maintainability.

Key Features:
-------------
- **WASD Minimap Navigation**: Move across the city grid using familiar keyboard controls.
- **Character Management**: Add and switch between characters with saved login credentials.
- **Minimap Visualization**: Display current location, nearby banks, taverns, transit stops, and AP-based destinations.
- **Discord API Integration**: All guild/shop location data now pulled from a live Discord bot (`locations.json`)—
  replaces in-app scraping and adds support for next move countdowns.
- **Nickname Mapping**: Internal names are now fully normalized across dropdowns (e.g., "Ace Porn" → "Ace Pawn").
- **Set Destination Dialog Enhancements**:
  - Dropdowns show nicknames, sorted and searchable.
  - Countdown overlays show remaining time to next guild/shop movement.
  - "Update Data" triggers the Discord bot API for a fresh scrape.
- **Theming Tools**: Customize UI colors and webview appearance using dedicated dialogs.
- **Log Viewer**: Live filterable log output with optional debug visibility.
- **Damage Calculator**: Plan combat attacks and see total required weapon damage.
- **Shopping List Tool**: Calculate item costs and charisma-discounted totals.
- **Power Reference Dialog**: Browse powers and set guild destinations for training.

Updated in v0.13.0:
-------------------
- Fully replaces legacy web scraping logic with Discord API sync (`locations.json`).
- Countdown timers displayed for next shop/guild rotation in SetDestination and Powers dialogs.
- Minimap draw method updated for stability and consistent label rendering.
- Dropdowns across dialogs now use canonical nickname mapping and normalized sorting.
- Logging system now uses debug level persistence and improved visibility control.
- Miscellaneous performance improvements and logic consolidation throughout.

Modules Used:
-------------
- **sys, os**: Core system integration and path handling.
- **requests**: API fetches from external JSON (locations.json).
- **re**: Regex for parsing and name normalization.
- **datetime**: Countdown and timestamp calculations.
- **bs4 (BeautifulSoup)**: Retained for legacy compatibility (no longer used for scraping).
- **PySide6**: Provides the full Qt GUI, dialogs, embedded webview, and event system.
- **sqlite3**: Local data storage for characters, locations, settings, and logs.
- **logging**: Captures logs for display and debugging.
- **math**: AP cost and damage calculations.
